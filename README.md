This application uses a standard video player, so keyboard control is normal:
+ right arrow - fast forward the video
+ left arrow - rewind the video
+ arrow up - the sound is louder
+ arrow down - the sound is quieter
+ space-play/pause

functional buttons of the player:
+ play/pause, 
+ sound control, 
+ full screen, 
+ video speed, 
+ picture in picture
